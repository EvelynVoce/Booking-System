# Booking-System
A C# doctors appointment booking system

This was a simple project I started as an introduction to C# and T-SQL.
From this project I learned how to use windows forms and Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio as well as the fundamentals of the C# programming language.

As of the latest update systems are in place to allow patients to book appointments with a doctor at a given surgery.
For simplicity appointments are split into hour long blocks.


Improvements:
- Make it so surgeries and doctors names are read from the database so that new doctors and surgeries do not need to be hard coded into the software 
- Add an account system so users can view their booked appointments
- Add an interface for doctors to see all their appointments
